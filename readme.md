### continuation of [Autonomous ROS](https://github.com/jakhon37/autonomous_ROS) Project with Jetson Nano B1 on
# Autonomous Jetson Robot

This project develops a mobile robot platform for autonomous navigation by integrating multiple sensors and actuators. Powered by a Jetson Nano B01, the system combines motor control, encoder-based feedback, LIDAR scanning, Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), navigation, Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based autonomous path planning, camera vision, and object detection capabilities.

## Installation and Launch Instructions

1. **Build the Workspace:**  
   From the workspace root (`autonomous_ROS/`):
   ```bash
   colcon build
   source install/setup.bash
   ```

2. **Launch All Nodes:**  
   Use the unified launch file in the `my_robot_launch` package:
   ```bash
   ros2 launch my_robot_launch all_nodes_launch.py
   ```
   This will:
   - Launch autonomous car nodes (motor control, encoder, etc.)
   - Start the rosbridge server (on port 9090)
   - Start the HTTP server (serving the web GUI on port 8000)

3. **Access the Web GUI:**  
   Open a web browser on a device in the same network and navigate to:
   ```
   http://<raspberry_pi_ip>:8000
   ```
   For example, if the Pi's IP is `192.168.219.100`, use:
   ```
   http://192.168.219.100:8000
   ```

4. **Remote Visualization (Optional):**  
   Run RViz on another machine (with ROS 2 Humble) to view topics such as `/map` and `/scan`.

## Dockerization

To simplify deployment and ensure a consistent environment, you can containerize your project using Docker.

### Example Dockerfile

Place check Dockerfile in the root directory (`autonomous_ROS/Dockerfile`)

### Building and Running the Docker Container

1. **Build the Image:**
   ```bash
   docker build -t autonomous_ros_project .
   ```

2. **Run the Container (using host networking for ROS 2 DDS discovery):**
   ```bash
   docker run -d \
    --privileged \
    --restart=always \
    --name auto_ros \
    --network=host \
    autonomous_ros_project

   ```

3. **Access the Web GUI:**  
   Open a browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://<raspberry_pi_ip>:8000
   ```
